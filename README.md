## ðŸ§  How it Works

The detection is based on:
- Length of the review (less than 20 characters = suspicious)
- Suspicious keywords like `"cheap"`, `"100%"`, `"great deal"`, `"unbelievable"`
- Overuse of exclamation marks (more than 3)

This is a **simulated check** and not based on machine learning â€” meant for educational/demo purposes.
